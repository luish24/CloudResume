            <section id="aboutme" class="aboutme">
                <p>Hi, my name is Luis and I am a passionate IT professional with about 10 years of experience in computer and end user support. Helping others with technical issues fulfills me because of the impact I'm having in their daily lives. I excell in a team environment, but can also work
                independently with attention to detail and great communication skills in different scenarios. My expertise is in problem-solving, software/hardware, troubleshooting, enterprise applications, on-premises/hybrid environments, and cloud technologies. I am currently attending Mt. San Antonio
                College, pursuing a Certificate of Achievement in Artifical Intelligence for Businesses, hoping to learn concepts on AI like data science, data analysis, data mining, text mining, business intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, 
                and artificial intelligence research. This is important to me because I like to stay current on new and emerging technologies like AI and cloud technologies. In 2023, I obtained 2 Certificates of Achievment from West Los Angeles College in AWS- Cloud Computing and Security Essentials. These
                certificates taught me the foundational concepts of AWS, emphasing compute and database services, networking (VPCs), and security/monitoring of the cloud services one deploys. Obtaining my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification was a confirmation of the knowledge learned at West Los Angeles Collge. 
                I also created my first cloud project on AWS, <a href="CloudResume.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">AWS Cloud Resume</a> which I hosted on AWS S3, but then moved to GitHub Pages.
                </p>
                <p>During my time at Urban Science, I was part of a global IT support team where I was exposed to technologies like Active Directory, Entra ID (Azure Active Directory), Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (SCCM), Intune, Microsoft 365 (Office 365), Citrix, MacOSX, and Windows 10/11/Server 2012-2022.
                    I was part of a few projects at Urban Science, which include:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>MECM Secondary Site Server OS and Configuration Manager upgrades</li>
                        <li>Migration of on-premises Active Directory distribution and security groups</li>
                        <li>SQL Server application updates of 500+ database servers using MECM</li>
                        <li>Quarterly laptop upgrades; Maintain/update Cireson asset tracking system</li>
                        <li>Intoduction of Urban Science Technologies via Learning Management System Module for on-boarding IT Orientation</li>
                      </ol>
